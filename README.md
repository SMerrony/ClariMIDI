# ClariMIDI
ClariMIDI is a MIDI wind controller based closely on a standard (Boehm) clarinet layout.

* 3D printed body
* 7 touch keys (the 'holes')
* 18 press keys (the 'keys')
* Breath sensor
* USB MIDI
* OLED menu
* Raspberry Pico microcontroller

It is specifically targetted at clarinettists who want to play a wind controller.
Standard clarinet fingerings are used, and the key layout mimics a normal clarinet.

N.B. This is a MIDI controller, it needs to be connected via USB-MIDI to a synthesizer to make
any sound.
